If you decide to use Nginx in addition to Apache, to serve static content, you'll want to install Nginx from source, as most package repositories have a very old version. Some dependencies needed by Nginx:
    
    sudo yum install zlib-devel pcre-devel openssl-devel
    # configure step for Nginx
    ./configure --with-http_ssl_module # use the OpenSSL library

When if installed from source, `configure` will output the list of files related to nginx. They are included in the Appendix below.

Please refer to 'conf/nginx.conf' for a sample config file for Nginx. It will serve static content and proxy all other requests to the Apache instance. This frees up Apache to handle dynamic content, and provides a good performance boost.
