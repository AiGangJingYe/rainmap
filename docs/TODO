This is Rainmap's TODO list. It contains a log of the features left to implement, bugs, and serves as a changelog between versions.

User Interface (HTML + CSS):
	- "new/edit" scan form
		- allow for target file upload
		- two save buttons
		- redirect to "view scan" and provide cost, schedule, run options
		- add port boxes to SYN and ACK
		- verbosity: "regular, verbose, extra verbose"
		- most popular ports
			- 100 [rid of 'fast mode']
			- 1000 [default]
			- other opts based on credit system boundaries
		- radio buttons between 'topmost popular'/'range'
		- "run now" and "save" submission choices
	- view scan results
		- add -oN to list of supported formats
		- improve XSL output, especially colouring of open vs. closed ports
		- notify when scan is done via AJAX
		- ability to diff with a previous scan result
		- full scan results emailed (with diff as requested)
			- email text version only if below certain size
	- settings on profile page
		- email options for:
			- completed/failed scans
			- scan output (text) if below certain threshold

Administrative Interface:
	- generate/view usage reports (scan types and options)
	- view abuse notices
	- display more information for various elements, i.e. the scan listing should display who owns them etc

Scan Execution:
	Worker processes:
		- message types:
			- 'settings-update' updates blacklist and global options
		- update local scan-specific settings (i.e. blacklists) [try to keep in-memory, not on disk]
	- scheduling
		- cancellations happen at DB level
		- schedule using a celerybeat task every 15 minutes
