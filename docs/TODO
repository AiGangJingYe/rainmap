## User Interface (HTML + CSS)

### "New/Edit Scan" form
* allow for target file upload
* two save buttons
* redirect to "view scan" and provide cost, schedule, run options
* add port boxes to SYN and ACK
* verbosity: "regular, verbose, extra verbose"
* most popular ports
    * 100 [rid of 'fast mode']
    * 1000 [default]
    * other opts based on credit system boundaries
* radio buttons between 'topmost popular'/'range'
* "run now" and "save" submission choices

### Scan results
* add -oN to list of supported formats
* improve XSL output, especially colouring of open vs. closed ports
* notify when scan is done via AJAX
* ability to diff with a previous scan result
* full scan results emailed (with diff as requested)
    * email text version only if below certain size

### Profile Settings
* email options for:
    * completed/failed scans
    * scan output (text) if below certain threshold


## Administrative Interface
* generate/view usage reports (scan types and options)
* view abuse notices
* display more information for various elements, e.g., the scan listing
should display who owns it etc.

## Scan Execution
### Worker processes
* message types:
    * 'settings-update' updates blacklist and global options
* update local scan-specific settings (i.e. blacklists) [try to keep in-
memory, not on disk]

### Scheduling
* cancellations happen at DB level
* schedule using a celerybeat task every 15 minutes

## Deployment
* make all conf files be templates, reading from a central configuration
